  <h1>Systems & Services Aggregation Group</h1>
  <p>
    SSAG is a privately held enterprise platform that designs, owns, and licenses
    revenue-generating business systems across technology, commerce, consulting, and automation.
  </p>
</header>

<section class="section">
  <h3>Positioning</h3>
  <p>
    SSAG does not operate as an agency, marketplace, or consultancy.
    We function as a systems holding group.
    Each SSAG division represents controlled intellectual property, operational infrastructure,
    and monetization logic designed for scale, licensing, and long-term enterprise value.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Controlled Business Systems</h2>

  <div class="division">
    <h3>Technology & Automation</h3>
    <p>
      Custom software systems, AI workflow integration, internal tools,
      and application infrastructure designed for enterprise and platform operators.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="division">
    <h3>Digital Marketing Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
      Revenue-driven marketing systems including copy, paid acquisition,
      content operations, and performance frameworks — structured as licensable engines,
      not services.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="division">
    <h3>Business Advisory & Optimization</h3>
    <p>
      Consulting systems focused on remote workforce compliance,
      AI operational deployment, and supply chain efficiency.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="division">
    <h3>Commerce & Distribution Systems</h3>
    <p>
      E-commerce, dropshipping, print-on-demand, arbitrage, and subscription
      frameworks built for low-capital deployment and repeatability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="division">
    <h3>Digital Assets & Licensing</h3>
    <p>
      SOP libraries, course infrastructure, certification programs,
      and white-label licensing structures.
    </p>
  </div>

</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Access Model</h2>
  <p>
    SSAG systems are not publicly distributed.
    Access is granted through licensing, partnership, or strategic engagement.
    Each engagement is scoped, documented, and governed by operational controls.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Why SSAG Exists</h2>
  <p>
    Most businesses fail not from lack of ideas, but from lack of systems.
    SSAG exists to aggregate, refine, and deploy business infrastructure
    that produces measurable outcomes independent of founder involvement.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="cta">
  <h2>Engagement</h2>
  <p>
    SSAG engages selectively with operators, partners, and institutions.
    Inquiries are reviewed based on strategic alignment.
